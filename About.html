<p>Cu is a Qo (pronounced Koh) which are the new fad pets in the fantasy city of Inthe. Qo are a byproduct of experimentation on Shepherds which are a shapeshifting livestock species who are given a misnomer as they are rather docile and often found spread in herds of other animals.I recently won a small creative writing contest with my exposition on the concept of Shepherds which I had created for the contest. Qo are a new idea I've had to make better use of having a nation's most heavily guarded secret hide in plain sight for a story I am working on. Qo are generally seen as family pets whose care is often given to children or young adults who travel frequently. They require minimal maintenance and create a positive feedback loop of love just as any other domesticated pet might. For children, they allow parents to acquire small toys or parts from abroad which the Qo will mimic rather than having to purchase the real thing. For families, Qo can often act as photo albums in a fantasy world without photography, which might bring back memories of a vacation or a ceremony. For travelers, Qo act as a memento from passed adventures. Whatever the object you bring to them, they bring it to life with their imitations. Cu is the pet of a character whose story I've been writing for about 2 years now. Her name is Rodinia and she travels through time unwillingly. Her story is told through a journal which she keeps for her daughter whom she knows will grow up without a mother. Cu goes along with that journal, as a sort of photo album of all of the things Rodinia did for her daughter in order to make the world a better place for her and a reminder of her love.</p>
