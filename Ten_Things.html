<h3>Ten Things</h3>
	
<h2>These are ten things I learned about Cu...</h2>
	
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Cu does not require a lot of maintenance or interaction.</li>
		<li>Cu and its species are a byproduct of mutilation of Shepherds, a true shapeshifting species.</li>
		<li>The reason they mimic other objects is because they are ripped away from their kind very early and are simply trying to understand who they are.</li>
		<li>Cu is completely harmless.</li>
		<li>Cu is capable of love and loves Rodinia, but wishes she would be around more often. It does not understand why she leaves this timeline so frequently.</li>
		<li>Cu enjoys having magic cast on it, even if it is mostly immune to said magic. It feels comforting.</li>
		<li>Rodinia, Cu's owner, relies on Cu to be an anchor for her preferred time and location in Inthe. She believes it to be the same one she grew up in. </li>
		<li>Cu does not understand that each time Rodinia comes back, it has been multiple months or more since she last saw Cu. Cu just believes it is especially loved.</li>
		<li>Cu's favorite shape to take is a Rodinia's locket, which Cu does not let her take out of its terrarium. Cu enjoys this form because it makes her happy, not it. In her absence, Cu takes that form to feel close to her.</li>
		<li>Rodinia does not explicitly realize how important Cu is to her and vice versa. Both enjoy each other's company but would be devastated if something were to happen to the other. </li>
